Replicate the 2016 paper
_“Are There Environmental Benefits from Driving Electric Vehicles? The Importance of Local Factors”_ by _Holland et al. (2016)_ 
on the environmental benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) versus gas vehicles using updated data from 2019-2021

### Findings from the original study:

+ The marginal damages of EVs depend on which fuel source is being used to generate electricity
+ In metropolitan areas, gas vehicles have higher marginal damages
    
We limit the marginal damages calculations based only on **NOx** and **SO2** emissions only

## Key Terms

### Marginal Damages

The incremental negative effects on the environment are caused by an additional unit of pollution. In our case, it would be the damage in _$/mile_ of using an EV or a gas vehicle

### Interconnections 

+ The United States electrical grid consists of **3** main interconnections; **Eastern, Western, and Texas**
+ Each interconnection pulls its electricity from the grid and distributes it to each area within the interconnection
